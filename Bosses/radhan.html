                Radahn is the son of Radagon and Rennala, making him a sibling to Ranni and Rykard.
                He was raised as a warrior and idolized Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, even modeling his fighting style and physique after him.
                His title “Red Lion” reflects his fierce battlefield presence and his signature red mane.
