            <p>
                Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, was once the head of the Carian Royal Family, a lineage deeply rooted in sorcery and lunar magic.
                She also served as the leader of the Academy of Raya Lucaria, the foremost institution of magical learning in the Lands Between.
                Though not a demigod, she is a shardbearer, meaning she possesses a Great Rune, making her a key figure in the game's progression.
