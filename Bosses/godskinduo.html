                The Members: The duo consists of a Godskin Apostle (tall, slender, and agile) and a Godskin Noble (shorter, rotund, and brutal).
                Faction: Both belong to the Godskin Apostles, a cult that served the mysterious Gloam-Eyed Queen, an Empyrean who opposed Queen Marika.
                Purpose: Their mission was to slay gods using the Black Flame, a divine fire that could burn even immortals.

                It’s a special kind of fire that’s black and white in color.
                Unlike regular flame, it’s infused with death magic and can kill gods.
                It’s connected to the Rune of Death, which was removed from the Elden Ring by Queen Marika to make gods immortal
